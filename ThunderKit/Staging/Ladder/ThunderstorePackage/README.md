# Ladder

This mod will allow you to build ladders. This will make it so your beavers will be able to go straight up and down without having to build a stairwell.

## Disclaimer!

This plugin is currently only supported in the **experimental** version of Timberborn.

## How to use

You will find the ladder under the paths tab. 

## Installing

Recommended way to install this mod is through [Thunderstore](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/). You can install this plugin manually by cloning the repo, building it
and adding the dll to your bepinex plugins folder. This plugin is dependent on the magnificent [TimberAPI](https://github.com/Timberborn-Modding-Central/TimberAPI).

## Problems?

In case you experience problems, message me in the modding channel of the the Timberborn discord or message me directly (Tobbert#1607). I will try to fix it as soon as possible. :D
