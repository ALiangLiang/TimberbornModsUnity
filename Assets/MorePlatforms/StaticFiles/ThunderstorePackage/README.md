# More Platforms

Think that the current platforms limit your creativity? Then this mod will let you add 4 new platforms to the game which can be build to the side of mountains or stacks of levees, giving more freedom of placing buildings as anything can be below these platforms. There is another platform which is disabled by default as it can be placed nearly anywhere! You can enable it in de config.

# Disclaimer!

This plugin is currently only supported in the **experimental** version of Timberborn.

## Shoutout

The designs of the platforms are mostly made by Knatte_Anka. He also play tested it and helped balancing the costs. So a big shoutout to him for the ideas and massive help!

## How to use

All platforms can be found under the paths tab. You can place them to the side of any cliff or a stack of levees.

### Platform middle
The middle platforms are disabled by default and have to be enabled to use them. these platforms can be placed nearly everywhere. It should be noted that this makes it possible to make floating buildings and as such is not advised when you like reality and game integrity. This will allow the following for example:
