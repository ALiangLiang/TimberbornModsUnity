# Ferris Wheel

This mod adds a ferris wheel to the game. It's designed to be a little late-game as it requires treated planks. Though the payout should be plenty! Hope your beavers will enjoy it!

## Disclaimer!

This plugin is currently only supported in the **experimental** version of Timberborn.

## How to use

You will find the Ferris Wheel under the Well Being tab. 

## Installing

Recommended way to install this mod is through [Thunderstore](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/). You can install this plugin manually by cloning the repo, building it
and adding the dll to your bepinex plugins folder. This plugin is dependent on the magnificent [TimberAPI](https://github.com/Timberborn-Modding-Central/TimberAPI).
