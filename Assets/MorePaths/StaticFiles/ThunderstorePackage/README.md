# More Platforms

You know what would be boring? Only having one path! With this mod u can use different paths to diversify your city!

## Shoutout

Knatte_Anka helped out with making the icons and ironing out the details. So a big shoutout to him for the ideas and all the help!

## How to use

All paths can be found under the paths tab.

### Paths

These are the paths that are added with this mod. They have the same properties as normal path, but they just look different.
