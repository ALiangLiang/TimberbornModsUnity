# More Platforms

You know what would be boring? Only having one path! With this mod u can use different paths to diversify your city! Some also have buffs which require to be build, but will double the walking speed of your beavers. 

# Disclaimer!

This plugin is currently only supported in the **experimental** version of Timberborn.

## Shoutout

Knatte_Anka helped out with making the icons and ironing out the details. So a big shoutout to him for the ideas and all the help!

## How to use

All paths can be found under the paths tab.

### Stone Path

This path can only be used on the ground. Has the same properties as normal path, just looks different.

### Metal Path

This path will double the walking speed of your beavers when they are on it, but it requires one metal per path to be build.
