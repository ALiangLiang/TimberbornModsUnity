# Pipette Tool

Tired of searching for a building that you want to place? Then this mod is for you! You can use CTRL + CLICK to go into construction mode of that building. 

## How to use

The pipette button will be added to the bottom bar. You can also use CTRL + CLICK to activate it without the button. 

## Installing

Recommended way to install this mod is through [Thunderstore](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/). You can install this plugin manually by cloning the repo, building it and adding the dll to your bepinex plugins folder. This plugin is dependent on the magnificent [TimberAPI](https://github.com/Timberborn-Modding-Central/TimberAPI).
