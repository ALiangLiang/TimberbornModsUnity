This mod will allow you to build Higher Metal Floodgates (4-10 High) and more advance WaterAlarms that also act as Streamgauge.  

## Disclaimer!

This plugin is currently only supported in the **experimental** version of Timberborn.  
Currently only 4,5 exist for IronTeeth but they will come soon.

## How to use

You will find the Floodgates under the Landscape tab.

and adding the dll to your bepinex plugins folder. This plugin is dependent on the magnificent [TimberAPI](https://github.com/Timberborn-Modding-Central/TimberAPI).
